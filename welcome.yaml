  rules:
    Follow Discord's Rules: >
      Everyone within the server must follow [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
      and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
    
    Try to Speak English: >
      This server is English based and cannot be moderated properly if everyone doesn't talk in
      English. It is not an issue if you need a translator, and we will not tolerate users who make
      fun of those with poor and/or translated English.
    
    Be Respectful: >
      Be nice and keep all discussions civil. If someone is making you angry, do not retaliate
      against them. If you have a problem with them, go through the proper channels to voice your
      frustrations.
    
    Don't Spam: >
      Attempt to keep repeated messages and pings to a minimum. If someone asks you not to ping them,
      do not ping them.
    
    Respect Channels: >
      Keep all conversations in their proper channels. If two conversations are happening over each
      other, don't be afraid to create a thread to keep things organized.
