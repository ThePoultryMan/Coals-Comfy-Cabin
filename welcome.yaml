  rules:
    Follow Discord's Rules: >
      Everyone within the server must follow [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
      and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
      
    Be Respectful: >
          Be nice and keep all discussions civil. Treat everyone with respect. No harassment, racism,
          sexism, homophobia, transphobia, bigotry, or hate speech will be tolerated.

    No NSFW Content: >
      No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity,
      sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.
          
    Respect Channels: >
      Keep all conversations in their proper channels. If two conversations are happening over each
      other, don't be afraid to create a thread to keep things organized.
      
    Try to Speak English: >
      This server is English based and cannot be moderated properly if everyone doesn't talk in
      English. It is not an issue if you need a translator, and we will not tolerate users who make
      fun of those with poor and/or translated English.

    No Self-Promotion: >
      No self-promotion without permission from a staff member. Regardless of permission or not, do
      not DM other members self-promotion unless they explicitly request that you do so.
    
    Don't Spam: >
      Attempt to keep repeated messages and pings to a minimum. If someone asks you not to ping them,
      do not ping them.
